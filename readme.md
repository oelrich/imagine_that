# IMAGINE_THAT
Is me playing with a Raspberry Pi 3, a camera and Open CV.

## The Pi
This required a few steps to get going. My setup runs the latest (as of now) Jessie and a fresh build of Open CV 3.2.

## Developing
Since I am lazy and like my tools I set up a Samba share that I can reach from Windows. From that I can configure Visual Studio Code to access a Windows copy of Open CV for nice intellisense. The Raspberry mounts that share and builds from it.
